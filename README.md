## This uses...

1. [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/).
1. [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/) for terminal multiplexing.
1. [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) because it's simpler and allegedly faster than oh-my-zsh.
1. [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm#installation) to manage dotfiles.
1. [mjolnir](https://github.com/sdegutis/mjolnir) for window switching hotkeys.
1. [ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) for fast file searching.
1. [spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs) `git clone --recursive http://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d`

There's also vim in there, for old times' sake.

# Don't forget

- `git submodule update --init --recursive`
